And it was a double-header, to use some baseball terminology, because Fox made up for lost time by airing two episodes back-to-back. Of course, double the fun meant double the eliminations, so this week we had to bid farewell to two furry friends: the Penguin, aka comedian Sherri Shepherd, and the Black Widow, aka former child star Raven-Symone. Jenny McCarthy had guessed that pretty much every female contestant since Season1 was Shepherd, so she was destined to be correct eventually. As for the Black Widow, I got that one right. I knew that eight-legged diva was so Raven from the very beginning. Anyway, while I have missed The Masked Singer like a Rottweiler misses his bone, a flower misses the sun, or a black widow misses her web, on the plus side, the past two weeks have given me some time off to reflect, furiously pore over various Google search queries and Wikipedia pages, and change my uneducated guesses since the last time many of these kooky cosplay characters rocked the mic. I now return to the show refreshed, renewed, and ready to keep my semi-winning streak going."

His older sister wore a red wig and all-white as Wilma Flintstone, and his younger one was all smiles as Bamm-Bamm Rubble. Kardashian held Psalm in a tiny version of the outfit. North also dressed up for Halloween with her cousin Penelope and their friend. Kourtney Kardashian's daughter, 7, rocked a long white wig and an angel-devil costume, while North was a straight devil in red fur. As for Kim, the makeup mogul debuted an extravagant Elle Woods costume, channeling Reese Witherspoon in Legally Blonde. The Selfish author even recreated the character's iconic Harvard video essay from the 2001 movie, wearing pink and green sequined bathing suits and a pink dress, all with a blonde wig. The KKW Beauty creator has passed on her love of fashion and beauty to her daughter North. The little one loves makeup, but her dad, 42, doesn't approve. \"Her dad won't let her wear it,\" Kim told E! News in September. \"I think he had it, he changed all the rules. I'd let her wear, you know, she has a little red for Christmas, I'd let her wear a red lip, or I'd let her do one pop of something. I'd let her if she's wearing a black dress, a black lip. Kylie [Jenner] would give her all of these lip kits, so I kind of got in trouble for that. So, it's now no more makeup.\" The Los Angeles native opened up about their disagreement further the following month, telling the outlet: \"North is trying to get in on the makeup, but she's being blocked heavily because her dad has stopped all makeup for her until she is a teenager. It's a big discussion, a big fight in the household right now but it is what's best. I think as a parent you just learn and figure it out as you go and we realized we didn't really want her to wear makeup at a young age but she sees her mom putting on lipstick and lip gloss.\""

But after footage of Shelby's now-regular gesture of kindness toward 88-year-old Opal Zucca was posted online on October 15, the driver for Waste Management has become an online hero. Zucca's daughter Colette Kingston shared the video of Shelby guiding her mother back up the driveway of Zucca's Independence, Missouri, home on Facebook. After returning Zucca's trash can to its spot beside the house, Shelby gives her a hug and jovially compliments her hair. \"God bless you, as always, darling,\" Shelby says in the video. In the post, Kingston detailed the story behind it. \"In January, my mom fell while trying to bring the trash can back up her driveway and got hurt. This gentleman from Waste Management was there when it happened,\" she wrote. \"Ever since, he has brought the can back up the driveway for mom. This was him today helping her; he demonstrates such care for her. It takes a village,\" she said, adding that the \"small kind gesture\" serves as an \"enormous relief for us.\" Kingston rounded off the note with, \"Thank you kind sir. Love, the Zucca family.\" Shelby soon had local media requesting interviews, and he told Fox 4 News that he \"made a point of making sure\" that Zucca's incident in January would not be repeated.

      "abstract": "Fall family fun! Kim Kardashian, Kanye West and their kids went all out with elaborate Flintstone family costumes for Halloween. \"Yabba Dabba Doo!\" the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star, 39, captioned a series of photos of herself with her children North, 6, Saint, 4, Chicago, 21 months, and Psalm, 5 months. \"This family pic was such a challenge because Chicago was so scared of Dino! LOL We tried to explain and show her that it was just daddy but she didn't get the concept yet! So shout out to the photographer for editing her in & making our family Flinstones dreams come true!\" While the reality star channeled Betty Rubble in a black wig and blue dress, her son looked just like Fred Flintstone. His older sister wore a red wig and all-white as Wilma Flintstone, and his younger one was all smiles as Bamm-Bamm Rubble. Kardashian held Psalm in a tiny version of the outfit. North also dressed up for Halloween with her cousin Penelope and their friend. Kourtney Kardashian's daughter, 7, rocked a long white wig and an angel-devil costume, while North was a straight devil in red fur. As for Kim, the makeup mogul debuted an extravagant Elle Woods costume, channeling Reese Witherspoon in Legally Blonde. The Selfish author even recreated the character's iconic Harvard video essay from the 2001 movie, wearing pink and green sequined bathing suits and a pink dress, all with a blonde wig. The KKW Beauty creator has passed on her love of fashion and beauty to her daughter North. The little one loves makeup, but her dad, 42, doesn't approve. \"Her dad won't let her wear it,\" Kim told E! News in September. \"I think he had it, he changed all the rules. I'd let her wear, you know, she has a little red for Christmas, I'd let her wear a red lip, or I'd let her do one pop of something. I'd let her if she's wearing a black dress, a black lip. Kylie [Jenner] would give her all of these lip kits, so I kind of got in trouble for that. So, it's now no more makeup.\" The Los Angeles native opened up about their disagreement further the following month, telling the outlet: \"North is trying to get in on the makeup, but she's being blocked heavily because her dad has stopped all makeup for her until she is a teenager. It's a big discussion, a big fight in the household right now but it is what's best. I think as a parent you just learn and figure it out as you go and we realized we didn't really want her to wear makeup at a young age but she sees her mom putting on lipstick and lip gloss.\""

Garry McNabb was on a hike with friends at the Cliffs of Moher when they came across a waterfall that looked to be moving upwards instead of down toward the ocean, as expected. McNabb recorded the video, which shows some of the waterfall spraying back up onto the cliffs, as the winds seem to push the water against its natural trajectory. Backwards flowing waterfalls may be interesting but they are known to exist when particularly strong winds are present. Although the weather was not all sunshines and rainbows, McNabb got to experience a rare phenomenon in a beautiful setting, which made for a scenic hike with friends.

According to NOAA, \"if you are unable to make it to a safe shelter, either get down in your car and cover your head, or abandon your car and seek shelter in a low lying area such as a ditch or ravine.\" Credit: Marcus Diaz via Storyful"

      "abstract": "Storm chaser Marcus Diaz may think twice about how close he gets to the elements after large hailstones whizzed past his head from behind as he was filming an EF2 tornado in Tahoka, Texas, earlier this year. According to Accuweather, the winds in the tornado reached \"between 113 and 157 mph.\" Diaz posted footage of the moment he was filming a \"dusty EF-2 tornado at close range\" as the hailstones almost hit \"the camera from behind,\" to Twitter on October 17. The lucky storm chaser told Storyful the footage was recorded on May 5. No injuries were reported as a result of the storm. However, the cyclone ripped through agricultural areas, \"causing structural damage to farms and wrecking equipment, power lines, and irrigation systems,\" according to media reports. Diaz may be better served in the future by heeding the advice of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). According to NOAA, \"if you are unable to make it to a safe shelter, either get down in your car and cover your head, or abandon your car and seek shelter in a low lying area such as a ditch or ravine.\" Credit: Marcus Diaz via Storyful"

Rihan Hoglin, of Hoglin Honey Bees, posted this video to Instagram after he and his team collected the statue from a property in Manning, a suburb of Perth, Western Australia, on October 21. The caption said, \"You don't come across this every day … a lion statue packed full of bees. Wouldn't this be an awesome antitheft deterrent sitting in front of your house?\" Hoglin told Storyful that he and his team had been called to remove the bees from the garden decoration by its 75-year-old owner, who happened to be \"highly allergic to bee stings.\" The statue meant a great deal to its owner because it was a gift from her late grandson, Hoglin said. Hoglin Honey Bees removed the bees from the statue free of charge as a gesture of kindness. Credit: Hoglin Honey Bees via Storyful"

Footage captured by Marcy Zavala's doorbell camera shows a neighbor frantically knocking on her door, trying to warn the family that the fire was approaching. Zavala told Storyful her neighbor knew they had \"four little kids under the age of six and that it was very crucial\" to get them out. \"As soon I heard the knock I knew it was a fire\", Zavala said. \"I looked outside to see how close it was to see how much time we had, and it was a lot closer then I could have imagined.\" she added. The timestamp on Zavala's footage indicates that the neighbor began banging at her door shortly after 2 am. By 3 am, the Hillside Fire had grown to around 200 acres, the San Bernardino County Fire District said. By late afternoon, the fire had destroyed six homes and damaged another 18, fire officials said. \"I didn't think our house was going to make it!\" Zavala told Storyful. \"But the San Bernardino fighters are superheroes they saved this neighborhood!\" The following day, the fire department said crews were still working to contain the fire, but said it had not grown past 200 acres, and was at 70 percent containment.

DorothyHoney Mallari, a teacher at Los Medanos Elementary School in Pittsburg, a city 40 miles east of San Francisco, gave the song an educational twist and set up a tripod to film the class singalong. The tune discusses themes of schoolwork, friendship, and positivity. The video, shared on Facebook by the Pittsburg Unified School District, shows Mallari dancing on school desks and mouthing the words as the second graders enthusiastically sing and dance with her. The video even caught the attention of Lizzo herself. \" … this IS the best thing I've watched today,\" Lizzo said on Twitter when she retweeted the footage. Mallari told local media that she creates a song every year \"to reflect what's going on in the classroom and what songs the kids are into.\" At the time of writing, the video garnered more than 300,000 views and 5,000 shares.
